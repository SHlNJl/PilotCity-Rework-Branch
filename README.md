"# Snake Game - CSS Renderer

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jackrugile/pen/bGRWbK](https://codepen.io/jackrugile/pen/bGRWbK).

This is a basic snake game made with JavaScript for logic and CSS for rendering. Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the snake. You can loop through walls.

Good luck! Post your high score in the comments."

"We've adapted this game to use alan ai to direct the snake.

Simply click or activate the alan ai button then say the direction you want the snake to go ("up","down", etc.).

We spent hours trying over and over again, and this is the first working model. This is only a proof of concept that games can be controlled by voice commands."
